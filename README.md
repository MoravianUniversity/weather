## Basic git

A repo where we can explore basic `git` commands.


### Setup

To run this program, you must first install some third-party libraries.
The best way to do this is in a virtual environment.

* Create a virtual environment in the root of the project

  `python3 -m venv .venv`

* Activitate the virtual environment

  `source .venv/bin/activate`

* Install the libraries

  `pip install -r requirements.txt`


You only need to create the virtual environment and install the libraries
once.  Any other time you want to work on this project, you simply need
to activate the virtual environment (same command as above):


  `source .venv/bin/activate`


While the virtual environment is acdtive, you can execute the program 
using

  `python weather.py`
